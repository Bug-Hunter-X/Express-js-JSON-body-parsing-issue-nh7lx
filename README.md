# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The issue arises when the application fails to correctly parse the incoming JSON data, resulting in an empty `req.body` object.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js application attempts to handle POST requests to the `/data` endpoint. The application includes the `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON request bodies. However, under certain conditions (e.g., incorrect content-type header), the middleware may fail to parse the JSON, leading to an empty `req.body` object being passed to the request handler. This will prevent access to the expected data in the request.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `content-type` header of the request is set correctly to `application/json` and checking if the request body is actually parsed properly before continuing.
